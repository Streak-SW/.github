# Streak Stormworks

## Development

### Prerequisites 
All microcontrollers are developed using nameouschangey's [Stormworks Lua with LifeBoatAPI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NameousChangey.lifeboatapi). 

### Set up
1. Clone the desired repository, and open.
2. Inside the root directory, use the extension to create a New Stormworks Code Project, and select the current folder when prompted.
3. In addition to configuring the workspace as needed to use the extension, it will also create a new `MyMicrocontroller.lua` file. You can simply delete this file as it will not be needed. 
4. You are now up and running. Refer to the Extensions overview in the Marketplace for more information on using the extension.
